# Shared Apartment rent and voting power smart contract

## usecase
If you live in a shared apartment or something similar, like a dorm, it can be difficult to keep track of who paid rent. If there is a collective fund for the appartment, it can be difficult to decide how to spend the money. <br>
A smart contract can fix this problem!<br>
The owner of the apartment can use this smartcontract to keep track of the rent and the renters can use it to decide how to spend the money in the fund!

## workflow
- An owner creates the smart contract and sets the rent (will be payed to him)
- The owner adds addresses to the contract as renters
- each renter will have to pay the rent to the SC
- not paying will result in a strike, which can have consequenses
- each renter can pay additionally in a fund and can gain "Dorm Token"
- paying rent will also result in a small DormToken reward
- renters can vote with these tokens about how the money in the fund is spent (for example buy new chairs, ...) in the process these tokens are burned
- the owner can remove renters form the contract
