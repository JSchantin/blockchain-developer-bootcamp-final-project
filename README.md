# Shared Apartment smart contract

## usecase
If you live in a shared apartment or something similar, like a dorm, it can be difficult to keep track of who paid rent.<br>
A smart contract can fix this problem!<br>
The owner of the apartment can use this smartcontract to keep track of the rent which is paid in ETH. The renters can use this smartcontract to simplify the process of paying rent.
## workflow
- An owner creates an apartment in the smartcontract and sets the rent
- The owner adds addresses as renters to the apartment
- each renter will have to pay the rent to the contract
- not paying will result in a strike, which can have consequenses
- the owner can collect the rent every 30 days
- the owner can remove renters from the apartment or delete the apartment
